# Python: an introduction

+ program structure: constants, acquisition, computation, visualisation
+ variables and constants
+ `input()` and `print()`
+ `import` statement to access existing python libraries, for instance `import math`: to be put at the beginning of our program
+ `if` statement

### Details
+ `input()` always returns a string, a sequence of character, therefore if that data represents a value (integer or real), it needs to be converted, by means of `int()` or `float()`. 
+ given a value (integer or real) it is possible to covert and obtain a string consisting of the numerical characters (and the `"."` separator) representing the value into a string, by means of the `str()` function.

+ `if` -- `if`-`else` -- `if`-`elif`

## Exercises in class

::: exefatti
Write a Python program that receives in input a positive integer value (it is surely so) representing the side of a square and computes the area. Finally, it shows the result.

```python
# CONSTANT / ARBITRARY ASPECTS OF THE SOLUTION

# DATA ACQUISITION
side = int(input())

# COMPUTATION
area = side * side

# VISUALISATION
print(area)

```

::: exefatti
Write a Python program that receives in input a positive integer value (it is surely so) representing the radius of a circle and it computes the length of the circumference and its area. Finally, it shows the results.

Initial version:

```python
# CONSTANT / ARBITRARY ASPECTS OF THE SOLUTION
PI = 3.14159	/* it is a constant value: let us put a meaningful label and use it */

# DATA ACQUISITION
r = int(input())

# COMPUTATION
circ = 2 * r * PI
area = r * r * PI

# VISUALISATION
print(circ, area)

```

[file](../codice/01.circareacicle.1.py)

**Note**: for established values it is possible to _think_ that there is a library available. This is the case of the `math` library.

```python
# CONSTANT / ARBITRARY ASPECTS OF THE SOLUTION
import math

# DATA ACQUISITION
r = int(input())

# COMPUTATION
circ = 2 * r * math.pi
area = r * r * math.pi

# VISUALISATION
print(circ, area)

```

[file](../codice/01.circareacicle.2.py)

**Note**: avoid putting constants directly in the code. It reduces readability and flexibility.

::: exefatti
Write a python program that asks for a positive integer, representing a time expressed in seconds; the program  converts it into days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and finally shows the result.

```python
# CONSTANT / ARBITRARY ASPECTS OF THE SOLUTION
SEC_IN_MIN = 60
MIN_IN_HR = 60
HR_IN_DAY = 24
SEC_IN_HR = (SEC_IN_MIN * MIN_IN_HR)
SEC_IN_DAY = SEC_IN_HR * HR_IN_DAY

# DATA ACQUISITION
timesec = int(input())

# COMPUTATION
num_days = timesec // SEC_IN_DAY
trem = timesec % SEC_IN_DAY

num_hr = trem // SEC_IN_HR
trem = trem % SEC_IN_HR

num_min = trem // SEC_IN_MIN
num_sec = trem % SEC_IN_MIN

# VISUALISATION
print(num_days, num_hr, num_min, num_sec)
```

## Proposed exercises
::: exepro

Write a python program that receives a positive integer as input, representing an amount in euros. The program should calculate and display the number of €5 banknotes, €2 coins, and €1 coins needed to make up that amount, minimising the total number of pieces used.

:::

::: exepro
Write a python program that, after receiving an integer value, calculates and displays 1 if the value is positive, 0 otherwise.

:::

::: exepro

Write a python program that, after receiving an integer value, calculates and displays 1 if the value is odd, or 0 otherwise. Make a variation that does not use the remainder (modulus) operator.

:::

::: exepro

Write a python program that takes three positive values and determines whether they form a Pythagorean triple. If they do, display 1; otherwise, display 0.
:::

::: exepro


Write a python program that takes an integer value and displays `+` if the value is positive, `-` if it is negative, and a space character ` ` if it is zero.

:::

::: exepro

Write a python program that takes an integer value in the range `[1, 12]`, representing a month of the year (1 = January, etc.) and computes and displays the number of days in that month.

:::

::: exepro

Write a python program that takes two integer values: the first is the month, expected to be in the interval `[1, 12]`, the second one is the year: the program computes the number of days in that month, taking into account also the fact the year is a leap year or not.
