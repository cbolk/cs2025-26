# Tumor Growth Analysis in a Preclinical Drug Study

## 1. The Scenario

Pharmaceutical companies routinely test new cancer drugs in **preclinical mouse studies** before moving to human trials.
In such experiments, mice are assigned to different **drug regimens**, and their **tumor volume** is measured repeatedly over several weeks.

The dataset used in this project is adapted from the well-known *Pymaceuticals* study used in university data-science and biomedical informatics courses. It contains:

* Mouse-level information (sex, weight, assigned treatment)
* Repeated tumor measurements for each mouse at multiple time points
* Several drug regimens to compare

## 2. Your Task

Your objectives:

1. **Clean the datasets**
2. **Compute summary statistics** relevant to drug effectiveness
3. **Generate multiple scientific plots** visualizing tumor progression


## 3. The Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of two files:

### `mice.csv`

Contains one row per mouse:

| Column       | Description             |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Mouse ID     | Unique mouse identifier |
| Drug Regimen | Drug treatment assigned |
| Sex          | M or F                  |
| Age (months) | Age of the mouse        |
| Weight (g)   | Weight at baseline      |

### `studyresults.csv`

Contains one row per measurement:

| Column             | Description              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Mouse ID           | Mouse identifier         |
| Timepoint          | Day of tumor measurement |
| Tumor Volume (mm3) | Tumor size               |
| Metastatic Sites   | Number of metastases     |


## 4. Expected outcomes

At the end of the work, the following outcomes are expected:

Create at least **four publication-style plots**:

1. **Bar Chart:**
   Number of tumor measurements per drug regimen

2. **Line Plot:**
   Tumor volume vs. time for one example mouse
   + Select a mouse from a chosen regimen (e.g., Capomulin)
   + Plot tumor volume over time
   + Interpret whether the tumor is growing or shrinking


3. **Box Plot:**
   Final tumor volume distribution for selected treatments
   +  Extract the **last measurement** for each mouse
   +  Compare at least four treatments)

4. **Scatter Plot:**
   Mouse weight vs. final tumor volume (one regimen)
   + Using final tumor volume data for one regimen
   + Create a scatter plot of weight vs. tumor size


These charts should support someone in providing answers to the following questions:

* Which drug regimens appear most effective
* How tumor volume changes over time in sample subjects
* Whether mouse characteristics (e.g., weight) correlate with tumor size
* Possible outliers or anomalies in the study



## **Notes & Tips**

* Be careful with merged datasets—verify that timepoints and IDs align correctly.
* When creating final-timepoint data, ensure that *each mouse contributes exactly one value*.
* Visual clarity matters: choose readable axis labels and rotate category labels if needed.
