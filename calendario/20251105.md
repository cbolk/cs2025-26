Write a Python program that takes a series of numbers separated by `,` as input, identifies which of those numbers are perfect numbers, and prints their average.
A *perfect number*, according to the Greek mathematician Nicomachus, is defined as a number that equals its aliquot sum. For example: `6` is a perfect number, because it is equal to its aliquot sum: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. Same goes for `28`: `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`.
*Note*: an aliquot of a number `n` a divisor of `n` that is positive and is not `n` itself.

```Python
SEP = ","

def is_perfect(n):
    if n >= 2:
      aliquot_sum = 1

      halfplus1 = n // 2 + 1
      for i in range(2, halfplus1):
          if n % i == 0:
              aliquot_sum += i
      return aliquot_sum == n

    # this is the anomaly, handled at the end
    return False


# MAIN FLOW
in_seq = input("input: ")
in_values = in_seq.split(SEP)
perfect_nums = []
tot = 0
size = 0
for x in in_values:
    int_x = int(x)
    if is_perfect(int_x):
        perfect_nums.append(int_x)
        tot += int_x
        size += 1

avg = tot / size
print("Average:", avg)
```

Write a program that asks the user to enter a sequence of words, one per line, until they enter an empty line. For each word, count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in the word and return the count. 

```python
STOP = ""

def count_vowels(word):
    count = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter in "aeiouAEIOU":
            count += 1
    return count

# Input loop
word = input()
while word != STOP:
    num_vowels = count_vowels(word)
    print(f"{word}: {num_vowels} vowels")
    word = input()
```

Write a program that asks the user to enter a sequence of words, one per line, until they enter an empty line. For each word, analyze:
* How many vowels it contains 
* Whether it contains consecutive consonants 

Then, classify each word as:
* "smooth" if it has more than 2 vowels and no consonant cluster
* "rough" otherwise

Example:
```
- Input -

apple
banana
sky
orange

- Ouput -

You've inserted following words:
apple: rough
strength: rough
banana: smooth
sky: rough
orange: rough
```

```python
STOP = ""

def count_vowels(word):
    count = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter in "aeiouAEIOU":
            count += 1
    return count

def has_consonant_cluster(word):
    consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ"
    prev_is_consonant = False
    for letter in word:
        if letter in consonants:
            if prev_is_consonant:
                return True
            prev_is_consonant = True
        else:
            prev_is_consonant = False
    return False

def analyze_word(word):
    vowels = count_vowels(word)
    cluster = has_consonant_cluster(word)
    if vowels > 2 and not cluster:
        return "smooth"
    else:
        return "rough"


# Input
words_list = []
word = input()
while word != STOP:
    words_list.append(word)
    word = input()

# Output
print("You've inserted the following words:")
for word in words_list:
    result = analyze_word(word)
    print(f"{word}: {result}")

```

Write a Python program that takes in input a word from the user. Compute the score that a player would score for that word in a Scrabble game.
The values are the following:

| **letter**                   | **value** |
|------------------------------|-----------|
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T | 1         |
| D, G                         | 2         |
| B, C, M, P                   | 3         |
| F, H, V, W, Y                | 4         |
| K                            | 5         |
| J, X                         | 8         |
| Q, Z                         | 10        |

Example:
```
input: cabbage
output: 14
```

```Python

SCORES = {"a": 1, "c": 3, "b": 3, "e": 1, "d": 2, "g": 2, "f": 4, "i": 1, "h": 4, "k": 5, "j": 8, "m": 3, "l": 1, "o": 1, "n": 1, "q": 10, "p": 3, "s": 1,   "r": 1, "u": 1, "t": 1, "w": 4, "v": 4, "y": 4, "x": 8, "z": 10}

def scrabbleScore(word):
    total = 0
    for letter in word:
        total += SCORES[letter]
    return total

word = input("word: ")
print(scrabbleScore(word))

A hospital is screening patients for a condition called **TriCheck Illness**. A patient is flagged as “at risk” if all three of the following are true:

1. Temperature is above 37.5°C
2. Heart rate is above 100 bpm
3. Oxygen saturation is below 95%

Each reading consists of three space-separated values: temperature, heart rate, and oxygen level.
Write a program that:

* Accepts one sequence of readings per patient 
* Typing "stop" ends the input session.
* For each patient, displays whether they are “at risk.”
* At the end, displays how many patients are "at-risk".


```
Enter reading for patient 1:
38.2 105 94
>> Patient 1 is at risk

Enter reading for patient 2:
37.0 102 96
>> Patient 2: not at risk

Enter reading for patient 3:
stop

>> Total 1/2 patients at risk

```

Solution

```python

def is_at_risk(temp, heart_rate, oxygen):
    return temp > 37.5 and heart_rate > 100 and oxygen < 95


# Main program
at_risk_patients = 0
tot_patients = 0

STOP = 'stop'
print(f"Type '{STOP}' to end.\n")


while True:

    line = input(f"Enter readings for patient {tot_patients + 1}:\n")
    if line.strip().lower() == STOP:
        break

    # get values
    parts = line.split()
    temp = float(parts[0])
    heart = int(parts[1])
    oxygen = int(parts[2])

    if is_at_risk(temp, heart, oxygen):
        print(f">> Patient {patient_index} is at risk\n")
        at_risk_patients += 1
    else:
        print(f">> Patient {patient_index}: not at risk\n")
    
    tot_patients += 1

print(f">> Total {at_risk_patients}/{tot_patients} patients at risk")

```

Write a Python program that takes in input a sequence of **integer values** concluded when the user inputs a negative value. The program computes the **frequency of each digit** in each number and the overall **average number of digits**. The program prints a unique global horizontal histogram that shows the frequencies for digits that appear at least once, and displays the computed average.

Example:
```
input: 435 9 84931 940394 0 4831 48930 84843 74103 109 718 0 43 37431 3444 10094 11091 -54

output:
0: #########
1: ##########
3: ###########
4: ###############
5: #
7: ###
8: ######
9: ########

average: 3.7058823529411766
```

```Python


BASE = 10
SYMBOL = "#"

def eval_digits_frequency(value):
    """Return (freq_dict, ndigits) for the non-negative integer value."""
    freq = {d: 0 for d in range(BASE)}
    ndigits = 0
    if value == 0:
        freq[0] = 1
        ndigits = 1
    else:
        while value > 0:
            digit = value % BASE
            freq[digit] += 1
            value //= BASE
            ndigits += 1
    return freq, ndigits

def merge_frequencies(freqs):
    """Return a new dictionary merging a sequence of frequency dictionaries."""
    merged = {d: 0 for d in range(BASE)}
    for f in freqs:
        for d, c in f.items():
            merged[d] += c
    return merged

def display_histogram(freq):
    """Print horizontal histogram lines only for digits with non-zero counts."""
    for d in range(BASE):
        count = freq[d]
        if count > 0:
            print(f"{d}: {SYMBOL * count}")


# ---- Main program  ----

# Inputs
seq_values = []
freqs_list = []
total_digits = 0

while True:
    v = int(input())
    if v < 0:
        break
    seq_values.append(v)

# If no non-negative numbers were entered, handle gracefully
if len(seq_values) == 0:
    print("No non-negative integers entered.")
else:
    
    # Evaluate frequencies for each value
    for val in seq_values:
        freq, ndigits = eval_digits_frequency(val)
        freqs_list.append(freq)
        total_digits += ndigits

    # Merge all frequencies dicts
    global_freq = merge_frequencies(freqs_list)

    # Print histogram
    display_histogram(global_freq)

    # Calculate and print average number of digits
    average = total_digits / len(seq_values)
    print("Digits average:", average) 

```
