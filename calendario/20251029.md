## Proposed exercises

::: exepro
Write a program that receives in input a collection of words, one for each line, until an empty line is entered. The program computes and visualises for each word the lists of anagrams of the word itself.

```bash
listen
cat
silent
act
stressed
enlist
banana
tac
ananas
desserts

output:
listen silent enlist 
cat act tac 
stressed desserts 
banana 
ananas 
```


```python
def isanagram(word1, word2):
	size1 = len(word1)
	size2 = len(word2)

	if size1 == size2:
		used = [0]*size1
	else:
		res = False
	return res

word_anagrams = {}
latest_word = input().strip()
while entry != "":
	# search if there is already an anagram of the new word in the collection
	for element in word_anagrams:
		if isanagram(latest_word, element):
			anagrams = word_anagrams[element]
			word_anagrams[element] = anagrams.append()
		else:
			# at present there is no anagram of the present word
			words[latest_word] = []

	# next entry
	entry = input().strip()

for word, anagrams in word_anagrams.items():
	print(word, end=" ")
	for a in anagrams:
		print(a, end= " ")
	print()

```
