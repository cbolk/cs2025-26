Loading data and exploring characteristics

**Q1**: Load data.

```Python
FNAME_D = "./sourcefile/files/pd.disease.csv"
FNAME_S = "./sourcefile/files/pd.symptom.csv"
FNAME_DP = "./sourcefile/files/pd.disease_precaution.csv"
FNAME_DS = "./sourcefile/files/pd.disease_symptom.csv"

dfd = pd.csv_read(FNAME_D)
dfs = pd.csv_read(FNAME_S)
dfdp = pd.csv_read(FNAME_DP)
dfds = pd.csv_read(FNAME_DS)
```


**Q2**: Gather information on the dataset.

```Python
df.info()

print(df.describe())
```

**Q3**: Identify severe symptoms, identified by a weight equal or higher than 5.

```Python
SEVERITY = 5

dfs_sev = dfs[dfs.Weight >= SEVERITY]
dfs_sev = dfs_sev.reset_index()
dfs_sev = dfs_sev.drop(columns=['index'])

# directly
dfs_sev = dfs[dfs.Weight >= SEVERITY]
dfs_sev = dfs_sev.reset_index(drop=True)
```

**Q4**: Create a tidy dataframe for the diseases and symptoms.

```Python
dfd_t = pd.melt(dfds,
                var_name='SymptomNum',
                value_name='Symptom',
                id_vars='Disease')
```

## Proposed exercises

::: exepro

Write a program that accepts integer values from the user until 0 is introduced. The program saves values that are prime in file `primes.txt`. This is the solution of an AI tool to the problem. Would you accept it as is to make it your own in line with the guidelines learned during this class, or would you modify it? If you would modify, how?

```Python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**2**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = []

while True:
    try:
        num = int(input())
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid integer.")
        continue

    if num == 0:
        break

    if is_prime(num):
        primes.append(num)

# Save primes to file
with open("primes.txt", "w") as f:
    for p in primes:
        f.write(str(p) + "\n")

```
