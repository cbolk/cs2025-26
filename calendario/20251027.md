Write a Python program that receives a sequence of words, one of per line, until the user inserts an empty line. The program computes and displays the word that appears more often. There is a single word that matches this requirement.

```bash
apple
orange
banana
apple
orange
apple
apple
orange
banana
apple
orange
apple

apple 6
```


```python
STOP = ""

frequencies = {}

word = input()
if word != STOP:
	maxfword = word
	maxfreq = 1
	frequencies[word] = 1
	word = input()
	while word != STOP:
		#increment frequencies
		if word in frequencies.keys():
			num = frequencies[word] + 1
		else:
			num = 1
		frequencies[word] = num
		if num > maxfreq:
			maxfword = word
			maxfreq = num
		#next word
		word = input()
else:
	maxfword = ""
	maxfreq = 0
print(maxfword, maxfreq)
```

```python
STOP = ""

frequencies = []

word = input()
if word != STOP:
	maxfword = word
	maxfreq = 1
	frequencies.append([word, 1])
	word = input()
	while word != STOP:
		found = False
		for pair in frequencies:
			if pair[0] == word:
				found = True
				pair[1] = pair[1]+1
				break
		if found:
			num = pair[1]
		else:
			num = 1
			frequencies.append([word, num])

		if num > maxfreq:
			maxfword = word
			maxfreq = num
		#next word
		word = input()
else:
	maxfword = ""
	maxfreq = 0
print(maxfword, maxfreq)
```
