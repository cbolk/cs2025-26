## Exercises in class

::: exefatti
Write a Python program that accepts an integer and outputs True if it corresponds to a _leap_ year, False otherwise.

> Solution 1
> **Note**: AI fails to understand it is correct

```python
year = int(input("insert an integer: "))

if year % 4 == 0:
	if year % 100 != 0:
		isleap = True
	elif year % 400 == 0:
		isleap = True
	else:
		isleap = False
else:
	isleap = False

print(isleap)
```

> Solution 2

```python
year = int(input("insert an integer: "))

if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0:
	isleap = True
elif year % 400 == 0:
	isleap = True
else:
	isleap = False

print(isleap)
```

[file](../codice/04.leap.2.py)

> Solution 3


```python
year = int(input("insert an integer: "))

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or year % 400 == 0:
	isleap = True
else:
	isleap = False

print(isleap)
```

[file](../codice/04.leap.3.py)

> Solution 4


```python
year = int(input("insert an integer: "))

isleap = (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or year % 400 == 0

print(isleap)
```

[file](../codice/04.leap.4.py)


> Solution 5 - **to avoid**

```python
year = int(input("insert an integer: "))

isleap = False
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or year % 400 == 0:
	isleap = True

print(isleap)
```

::: exefatti
Write a Python program that accepts two integer values and it computes the smallest and the largest and displays them in increasing order.

```python
val1 = int(input("insert an integer: "))
val2 = int(input("insert an integer: "))

if val1 > val2:
	low = val2
	high = val1
else:
	low = val1
	high = val2
print(low, high)
```

::: exefatti
Write a Python program that receives in input a sequence of 35 integers and it computes and displays minimum, maximum and average values of those values.

```python
# CONSTANT / ARBITRARY ASPECTS OF THE SOLUTION
NVAL = 35

val = int(input())
minv = val
maxv = tot = val

i = 1
while i < NVAL:
	val = int(input())
	tot += val
	if val >= maxv:
		maxv = val
	elif val < minv:
		minv = val
	i += 1

avgv = tot / NVAL
print(minv, maxv, avgv)
```

::: exefatti
Write a Python program that keeps asking the user for a non-negative integer until the input is valid, then calculates and prints its factorial.

```python
n = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))
while n < 0:
    n = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))

# Compute factorial using a while loop
fact = 1
i = 2
while i <= n:
    fact *= i
    i += 1

print(fact)
```

[file](../codice/07.factorial.1.py)

> Solution with a `for` statement

```python
n = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))
while n < 0:
    n = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))

# Compute factorial using a while loop
fact = 1
for i in range(2, n+1):
    fact *= i

print(fact)
```

::: exefatti
Write a Python program that keeps asking the user for a non-negative integer until the input is valid, then it computes and prints if it is a prime number (True) or not (False).


```python
n = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))
while n < 0:
    n = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))

# Prime check
if n == 2:
    is_prime = True
elif n == 1 or n % 2 == 0:
    is_prime = False
else:
    is_prime = True
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n and is_prime:
        if n % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
        i += 2  # skip even numbers

print(is_prime)
```

```python
n = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))
while n < 0:
    n = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))

# Prime check

            break

## Proposed exercises
::: exepro

Write a Python program that receives in input a sequence of integers of an a-priori unknown length. When the user inserts `0` the sequence is considered terminated and `0` is not part of the dataset. The program computes and displays minimum, maximum and average values of those values. The user will surely insert a valid integer before the terminal `0`.


```python
# CONSTANT / ARBITRARY ASPECTS OF THE SOLUTION
STOP = 0

val = int(input())
minv = val
maxv = tot = val
nval = 1

val = int(input())
while val != STOP:
	tot += val
	if val > maxv:
		maxv = val
	elif val < minv:
		minv = val
	nval += 1
	val = int(input())

avgv = tot / nval
print(minv, maxv, avgv)
```

::: exepro
Write a Python program that repeatedly asks the user to enter integers one at a time.
The input ends when the user enters `0` (which is not part of the data set).
The program counts:

+ the number of even numbers entered,
+ the number of odd numbers entered, and
+ the total count of numbers entered

```python
STOP = 0

count_e = 0
count_o = 0

n = int(input())
while n != STOP:
	if n % 2 == 0:
		count_e += 1
	else:
		count_o += 1
	n = int(input())

count = count_e + count_o
print(count_e, count_o, count)
```

::: exepro
Write a Python program that, given to integers received from the user in increasing order, finds and displays all the numbers **between** the two (boundary excluded) that only contain even digits.

```python
BASE = 10

start = int(input())
end = int(input())

if (start+1 % 2) == 1:	/* if it is odd, it does not have all even digits */
	start += 1

i = start
while i < end:
	num = i
	all_even = True
	while (num > 0) and all_even:
		digit = num % BASE
		if digit % 2 != 0:
			all_even = False
		num //= BASE
	if all_even:
		print(i)
	i += 2
```

[file](../codice/90.fromtoeven.1.py)


> Version with `for` statement

```python
BASE = 10

start = int(input())
end = int(input())

if (start+1 % 2) == 1:	/* if it is odd, it does not have all even digits */
	start += 1

for i in range(start, end, 2):
	num = i
	all_even = True
	while (num > 0) and all_even:
		digit = num % BASE
		if digit % 2 != 0:
			all_even = False
		num //= BASE
	if all_even:
		print(i)
```

::: exepro
Write a Python program that receives in input 4 integer values, `start1`, `end1`, `start2`, `end2`, such that it is surely `start1 < end1` and `start2 < end2`. These two pairs identify the starting and ending points of two segments. The program computes if the segments overlap and if one is completely included in the other. The program displays to digits: the first digit is 1 when segments overlap, 0 otherwise; the second digit is 1 when one segments is completely included in the other, 0 otherwise.
Examples:

```bash
input: 5 7 7 9 
output: 10 (segments overlap on 7, no inclusion)
input: 2 8 3 7 
output: 11 (segments overlap, 3-7 is included in 2-8)
input: 4 12 1 12 
output: 11 (segments overlap, 1-12 is included in 4-12)
input: 4 11 23 27 
output: 00 (segments do not overlap, no inclusion)
```
