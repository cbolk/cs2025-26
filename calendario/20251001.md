## Exercises in class
Given two sequences of characters, determine if they are one the anagram of the other.

### Alternative discussed solutions
+ For each element of the first sequence verify if there is a corresponding element NOT ALREADY USED in the second sequence. If there is, mark it as USED and proceed with the next element. If such an element does not exist, interrupt the analysis and report that sequences are NOT ANAGRAMS. If completing the analysis, the two sequences are ANAGRAMS.
+ Prepare two counters for each possible symbol (character, digit, punctuation, ...) and set them to 0. For each element in the f
