## Exercises in class
Given two strings, determine if they are one the anagram of the other.

## Proposed exercises
Make a flowchart for an algorithm that asks for a positive number of seconds, then converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds, and finally shows the result. Examples:
```bash
26 = 0h 0m 26s 
234 = 0h 3m 54s
3725 = 1h 2m 5s
```

Make a flowchart for an algorithm that asks for a positive number of seconds, then converts it into days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and finally shows the result.
Examples:
```bash
26 = 0d 0h 0m 26s 
234 = 0d 0h 3m 54s
3725 = 0d 1h 2m 5s
93789 = 1d 2h 3m 9s
```

## Additional exercises
Make a flowchart for  an algorithm that acquires a positive integer value (it is surely so) representing the side of a square and computes the area. Finally, it shows the result.

Make a flowchart for an algorithm that acquires a positive integer value (it is surely so) representing the radius of a circle and computes the length of the circumference and area. Finally, it shows the results.
