# The "No-Show" Crisis

## 1. The Scenario

*Missing Care Medical Center* is facing a significant operational challenge. Over the past few months, we have noticed an alarming increase in the number of patients who book appointments but fail to show up without cancelling ("No-Shows").

This is not just an administrative annoyance; it is a critical biomedical and financial issue.

1.  **Health Impact:** Patients with chronic conditions (like hypertension or diabetes) are missing routine check-ups, leading to emergency room visits later.

2.  **Resource Waste:** Highly specialized doctors and expensive equipment sit idle while other patients remain on long waiting lists.

We have exported a raw dump of 110,000 appointment records from our legacy scheduling software. However, our internal IT team is overwhelmed, and the data is "messy." 

## 2. Your Task

We need to understand **who** is not showing up and **why**, so we can implement a new reminder policy next month.

Your work will be divided into two main pillars:

### Phase A: Data Rescue (Engineering)

Our legacy database is old. The export contains several inconsistencies that make analysis impossible in its current state. You need to:

+   **Standardize the structure:** Some column names are misspelled (e.g., "Hipertension") or confusing.
+   **Fix the Timeline:** The dates are currently stored as simple text strings. We need them converted to a format where we can calculate time differences.
+   **Sanity Check:** We suspect there is "dirty data" (e.g., ages listed as negative numbers). These must be identified and removed or corrected.

### Phase B: Diagnostic Analysis (Visualization)

Once the data is clean, knowledge has to be extracted. We need **visual** evidence regarding:

+   **The "Cold Feet" Theory:** Does a longer waiting period between booking the appointment and the actual visit increase the chance of a no-show?
+   **The SMS Factor:** We spend thousands of euro sending SMS reminders. Does receiving one SMS actually lower the no-show rate?

+   **Demographics & Conditions:** Are younger patients less reliable than older ones? Do patients with serious conditions (Alcoholism, Diabetes) struggle to attend more than healthy patients?

## 3. The Dataset Structure

You will be provided with the file `teamwork.noshow.csv`. It contains the following fields:

*   `PatientId`: Identification of a patient.
*   `AppointmentID`: Identification of each appointment.
*   `Gender`: Male or Female.
*   `ScheduledDay`: The day the patient called to book the appointment.
*   `AppointmentDay`: The day of the actual medical visit.
*   `Age`: How old the patient is.
*   `Neighbourhood`: Where the appointment takes place.
*   `Scholarship`: Indicates if the patient receives social welfare assistance.
*   `Hipertension`: True or False.
*   `Diabetes`: True or False.
*   `Alcoholism`: True or False.
*   `Handcap`: True or False.
*   `SMS_received`: 1 or more messages sent to the patient.
*   `No-show`: **"Yes"** or **"No"**. (Note: "Yes" means they *did not* come. "No" means they *did* come).

## 4. Expected outcomes

At the end of the work, the following outcomes are expected:

1.  **A Cleaned Dataset:** Ready for future machine learning models.
2.  **The "Waiting Time" Feature:** A new calculated column showing the days elapsed between scheduling and the appointment.
3.  **Visual Insights:** At least 3 charts answering our hypotheses (e.g., Bar charts comparing No-Show rates by condition, Boxplots for waiting times).
